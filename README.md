## Xy-scooter: Final project for MUSA550

### TEAM: Xinge Zhang & Yiping Ying

Welcome to our scooter analysis!
In this project, we will try to analyze and compare scooter usage in Austin and Chicago. We will try to find out whether commuters take scooters depending on the community attributes, usage of mobility modes, and peak hours.

The reason we created the analytical model is that we want to better determine which areas in the same city have better scooter potential usage and whether there is a difference in the scooter population between cities. Through exploratory analysis of the e-scooter dataset in Austin and Chicago 2019, and the census tract-based analysis model, we will be able to help decision-makers to identify more valuable investment areas, and help planners further understand the motivation and behavioral characteristics of people using shared scooters.
